This repository contains research code used for interpretting the outputs of PlotToSat. It is important to note that this code has not been fully tested, it contains hardcoded code as was needed to get the required results. Also, function may have been modified during testing to perform different tasks than the initially stated and, therefore, a function many not do what it states it does. Additionally, a lot of this code was generated with support from ChatGPT using a huge amount of prons and every time testing that it does what I needed it to do. It may be useful for getting a rough idea on how to interpet features vectors exported by PlotToSat. Please use with caution.
