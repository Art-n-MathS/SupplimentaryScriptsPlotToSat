This repository contains research code used for interpreting the outputs of PlotToSat. Much of this code was developed with the assistance of ChatGPT. 

Please be aware that this code has been developed for specific purposed and was not fully tested. It contains hardcoded elements to achieve specific results. Additionally, some functions may not perform what they description states and/or contain bugs. This happens because some of the code was modified or further developped after the description was written and once a function was not working, I often implemented an alternative solution but kept all code in this project.  

For the aforementioned reason, while this code may provide a rough guide for interpreting feature vectors exported by PlotToSat, it is essential to use it with caution. I recommend thoroughly testing and verifying the code before applying it to your own work.
